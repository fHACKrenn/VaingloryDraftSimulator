He will maintain this move-speed bonus so long as heâ€™s alongside any allied hero.","Fortress marks the target enemy as prey and his next basic attack becomes a short-range lunge. Fortress and allied heroes gain move speed when moving toward anything marked as prey.","Fortress claws his target for crystal damage and causes it to bleed. Bleeding targets take 25 +15% of crystal power as damage every second. Attacks from Fortress and his allies have +10% lifesteal against bleeding targets and increase bleeding by one stack. Upon reaching 6 stacks, the target is dealt a burst of damage based on its max health, is slowed by 30% and receives mortal wound (-33% healing).","Fortress howls, gaining increased health and attack speed and calls to him a pack of wolves. Each pack wolf seeks out a different enemy hero. These wolves apply bleeding with their basic attacks."]}
