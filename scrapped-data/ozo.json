(This does not affect health regeneration.)","Ozo performs a three-hit combo with his ring. Each part of the combo is a separate tap within a 5-second window.\r\n\r\nFirst hit: Ozo thrusts his ring forward, damaging the target and other enemies in front of him.\r\nSecond hit: Ozo dashes through his target and deals damage.\r\nFinal hit: Ozo spins, damaging all nearby enemies.\r\nEach hit deals weapon damage and triggers basic-attack effects. Ozo heals for each enemy damaged by any of these hits, with hero damage granting a greater heal.","Ozo hops onto the head of a nearby target (enemy, ally or creature), slowing it by 60% and damaging it. While Ozo is airborne, quickly tap a nearby target to bounce off one head to the other. Three hops maximum. The final hop deals increased damage. If Ozo hops at least twice, heâ€™ll get a burst of move speed. Reduced crystal scaling vs. minions.","Ozo charges up before tumbling to a targeted enemy hero. If he reaches the target within 1 second, he deals damage, stuns for 0.5 seconds and flips the target over his ring to behind him. While tumbling, Ozo will knock aside and deal reduced damage to all other enemies in his path."]}
