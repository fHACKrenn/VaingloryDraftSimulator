The star will briefly linger on the field. If Celeste uses this ability on an existing star, the star will go supernova, dealing more crystal damage in a larger area. Deals reduced damage to minions.","After a brief delay, the target location collapses and nearby enemies are stunned and take crystal damage.","Celeste launches a storm of stars that travel across the world. Stars collide with the first enemy they hit, dealing crystal damage in an area. The number of stars increases each time Solar Storm is upgraded. Deals 50% damage to non-heroes and does not damage structures."]}
