When attacking enemies with Resonance, this damage will bounce to two nearby enemies and refresh Resonance on that target.","Vox dashes in the targeted direction, throwing two attacks to the nearest enemy marked by Resonance (prioritizing heroes).","Vox emits a sonic pulse that echoes off nearby enemies and applies Resonance. The pulse applies a slow that is significantly stronger near its center. Each upgrade to Pulse increases the damage Vox's basic & bouncing attacks deal to targets with Resonance.","Vox fires an ultrasonic wave that applies Resonance to enemies in its path and refreshes all Resonance. Shortly after, a wide shockwave explodes along the same path, dealing crystal damage and silencing enemies. Striking enemy heroes with the shockwave will also cause Resonance to bounce."]}
