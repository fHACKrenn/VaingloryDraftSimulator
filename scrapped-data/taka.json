Every 5 seconds, Taka is guaranteed a critical strike. Taka gains 1 Ki stack when he performs an ability or critical strike (up to 5 stacks). Each stack of Ki speeds up his guaranteed critical strikes 0.9 secs and grants 25% cooldown acceleration.","Taka flips over his target, cutting it with his switchblade. Taka doesn't take damage while in mid-air.","Taka throws a smoke bomb at his feet, vanishing from enemy sight and gaining move speed. This illusion ends early if he strikes a target or he takes direct damage. Turrets, Scout Traps and Flare Guns will see Taka while invisible. Overdrive: Kaku heals Taka for 1% of his max health per second while invisible.","Taka bursts through his target, carving an X with his switchblades for lethal damage. The target suffers a mortal wound, reducing its healing by 50% and taking damage per second over the next 3 seconds. Grants 3 stacks of Ki."]}
