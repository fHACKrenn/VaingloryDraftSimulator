Once empowered, Krul briefly gains 2 move speed and his next basic attack will slow the target by 40% for 3 seconds.","Krul dashes to the target, deals damage and applies basic-attack effects. Activating Dead Man's Rush grants Krul a health barrier for 2.5 seconds.","Passive: Basic attacks & abilities apply Weakness for 4 seconds (up to 8 stacks). Each stack reduces the target's attack speed and crystal power by 10% and increases Krul's lifesteal against the weakened target.\r\nActivate: Detonate the stacks to deal damage and regain health based on the number of stacks consumed.","Krul pulls Hellrazor from his chest and hurls it in the targeted direction. If the sword hits an enemy hero (on the way out or the way back), it stuns and slows the target and deals damage. Stun duration is longer based on the distance the sword has traveled."]}
