Samuel then draws that power back to himself, restoring 50-160 health and 50-160 energy. The restorative effects are only 25% as effective against non-heroes.","Samuel fires two quick shots from his wands at a target location that impact on the first enemy hit. Samuel can move between the shots.\r\n\r\nIf Samuel is standing inside the field from Drifting Dark, this ability is empowered. While empowered, the shots move faster, travel farther, deal additional damage and burst upon impact dealing damage in a small area. In addition, the cooldown for this ability is significantly reduced.","Samuel creates a large field of darkness that slowly drifts forward, damaging enemies who stand inside it. If Samuel also stands inside, he heals for a small amount for each affected target.","After a short delay, Samuel summons a phantasm at the target location, which puts nearby enemies to sleep. Enemies inflicted are unable to move or act.\r\n\r\nDealing direct damage to a sleeping enemy with an attack or ability will wake them up."]}
